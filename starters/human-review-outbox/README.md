# Human Review Outbox

An agent buys a signed review decision only after a case reaches a ready state and the mandate remains valid.

This self-contained REAPP starter protects `GET /reviews/:caseId/decision` with a request-bound v2 payment on Stellar testnet. The MandateRegistry contract is the spending authority; the SDK and this application are untrusted clients of that contract.

## Start

You need Node.js 20 or newer. From this extracted folder:

```bash
npm ci
npm run check
npm run demo
```

The offline gate check runs deterministic business, rejection, delivery-tamper, and free-route vectors. The live demo creates disposable testnet accounts, starts this kit's local Express fulfillment server, registers a scoped mandate, pays with the consumer, records explorer evidence, and runs the named negative check. It never requests a wallet or mainnet secret.
## Scenario

- Paid resource: `GET /reviews/:caseId/decision`
- Price policy: exact decimal amounts declared by the scenario
- Negative path: `authority-expires-in-queue` — A distinct short-lived mandate expires before settlement against the ready delayed-case fixture, and the contract rejects payment.
- Fixtures: Two ready-state deterministic decisions signed by a clearly labeled fixture reviewer; one uses a queue duration beyond the example SLA.

Serve two ready-state fixture decisions, validate a fixture HMAC signature, and demonstrate contract-mandate expiry before settlement.

### Capabilities

- `expiry`
- `durable-recovery`
- `request-binding`
- `independent-verification`

## Files to edit

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `scenario/scenario.mjs` | Distinct deterministic business rules, fixtures, delivery checks, and rejection check. |
| `src/consumer.mjs` | Runs the disposable consumer and calls the paid route through the shared request-bound runtime. |
| `src/fulfillment.mjs` | Runs this scenario as a local 402-gated Express service. |
| `shared/` | Copied, self-contained payment, storage, recovery, and evidence runtime. |
| `src/check.mjs` | Executes this scenario's offline vectors. |
| `src/reset.mjs` | Archives resolved local state and refuses unsafe cleanup. |

## Run fulfillment separately

The one-command demo starts both sides automatically. To inspect or modify the server independently:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Put a funded Stellar testnet public G-address in REAPP_MERCHANT.
npm run fulfillment
```

Keep the challenge secret private and stable. The reference file store is for one local Node process; multi-process deployments need one shared linearizable store implementing the same interface.

## Safety and recovery

- Paid work is GET-only and bound to the exact origin, method, resource, merchant, asset, amount, registry, and short-lived challenge.
- Delivery evidence is committed before the client acknowledges and clears a settlement receipt.
- Exact same-proof replay returns byte-identical recovery; an old proof on a new resource is rejected, and a freshly rebound proof reusing an old transaction conflicts.
- State under `.reapp/` is private and ignored by Git. Run `npm run reset` only after all payment and fulfillment evidence is resolved.
