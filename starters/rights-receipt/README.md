# Rights Receipt

Purchase an exact asset-license version and receive content plus a receipt containing content and terms hashes and the settlement transaction hash.

This self-contained REAPP starter protects `GET /licenses/:assetId/:licenseVersion` with a request-bound v2 payment on Stellar testnet. The MandateRegistry contract is the spending authority; the SDK and this application are untrusted clients of that contract.

## Start

You need Node.js 20 or newer. From this extracted folder:

```bash
npm ci
npm run check
npm run demo
```

The offline gate check runs deterministic business, rejection, delivery-tamper, and free-route vectors. The live demo creates disposable testnet accounts, starts this kit's local Express fulfillment server, registers a scoped mandate, pays with the consumer, records explorer evidence, and runs the named negative check. It never requests a wallet or mainnet secret.
## Scenario

- Paid resource: `GET /licenses/:assetId/:licenseVersion`
- Price policy: exact decimal amounts declared by the scenario
- Negative path: `license-version-rebinding` — Payment for another asset or license version cannot unlock the requested content.
- Fixtures: Bundled text and CSV data assets with stable hashes and clearly labeled sample license terms.

Select text or data fixtures by asset ID and license version, hash the content and terms, record the settlement transaction hash, and verify the asset, version, content, and terms.

### Capabilities

- `request-binding`
- `license-versioning`
- `explorer-evidence`
- `independent-verification`

## Files to edit

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `scenario/scenario.mjs` | Distinct deterministic business rules, fixtures, delivery checks, and rejection check. |
| `src/consumer.mjs` | Runs the disposable consumer and calls the paid route through the shared request-bound runtime. |
| `src/fulfillment.mjs` | Runs this scenario as a local 402-gated Express service. |
| `shared/` | Copied, self-contained payment, storage, recovery, and evidence runtime. |
| `src/check.mjs` | Executes this scenario's offline vectors. |
| `src/reset.mjs` | Archives resolved local state and refuses unsafe cleanup. |

## Run fulfillment separately

The one-command demo starts both sides automatically. To inspect or modify the server independently:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Put a funded Stellar testnet public G-address in REAPP_MERCHANT.
npm run fulfillment
```

Keep the challenge secret private and stable. The reference file store is for one local Node process; multi-process deployments need one shared linearizable store implementing the same interface.

## Safety and recovery

- Paid work is GET-only and bound to the exact origin, method, resource, merchant, asset, amount, registry, and short-lived challenge.
- Delivery evidence is committed before the client acknowledges and clears a settlement receipt.
- Exact same-proof replay returns byte-identical recovery; an old proof on a new resource is rejected, and a freshly rebound proof reusing an old transaction conflicts.
- State under `.reapp/` is private and ignored by Git. Run `npm run reset` only after all payment and fulfillment evidence is resolved.

Catalog identity: `rights-receipt` · fixture policy: `deterministic-and-clearly-labeled`.
