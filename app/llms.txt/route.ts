> Open-source agentic payments infrastructure: bounded mandates, TypeScript SDKs, Express verification, AP2 bridging, and live Stellar testnet demonstrations.

REAPP separates adaptive agent planning from deterministic financial authority. A principal grants a scoped mandate; the contract and verification layers enforce merchant, asset, budget, expiry, sequence, and resource constraints. The live site demonstrates both permitted payments and contract-enforced rejection paths.

## Start here

- [REAPP SDK documentation](https://reapp.live/): Install the published packages and understand the end-to-end consumer and merchant flow.
- [Express payment flow](https://reapp.live/express): Pay-per-use API fulfillment with settlement and one-time redemption verification.
- [Hackathon starter](https://reapp.live/hackathon): Start from an empty folder, run a local consumer against hosted fulfillment, and inspect matching testnet evidence.
- [AP2 mandate bridge](https://reapp.live/ap2): Canonical intent and transaction mandate checks, signatures, scope, expiry, and replay protection.
- [CLI](https://reapp.live/cli): Initialize actors, create a mandate, pay, inspect evidence, and exercise rejection paths.

## Live demonstrations

- [Research agent](https://reapp.live/research): An AI agent buys paid sources until the on-chain budget is exhausted.
- [Video paywall](https://reapp.live/video): Three permitted pay-per-use unlocks followed by a rejected fourth payment.
- [Composite mandates](https://reapp.live/composites): Multiple agents coordinate a group buy and atomic clearing result.
- [Toolkit preview](https://reapp.live/t2): Guided access to newer REAPP demonstrations.
