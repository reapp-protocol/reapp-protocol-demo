# ⚡ reapp-protocol-demo

**The live REAPP developer experience: 20 production-shaped starter packs for contract-enforced agent payments on Stellar testnet. The SDK prepares the request; the MandateRegistry contract decides whether money moves.**

---

## Choose from 20 starter packs

Share the full catalog with your team at **[reapp.live/hackathon](https://reapp.live/hackathon)**. Each starter name below opens a standalone README you can share directly; each ZIP link downloads that exact starter.

Every pack contains editable consumer and Express fulfillment source, deterministic fixtures, exact package versions, an offline gate check, a named rejection path, and a downloadable ZIP recorded in the [public SHA-256 manifest](https://reapp.live/starters/v1/manifest.json).

### Make any starter yours

Start with three files; the payment and recovery machinery can stay untouched until you need advanced customization.

| File | What you change |
|---|---|
| `scenario/scenario.mjs` | Your product rules, fixtures, delivery checks, and rejection check. |
| `src/consumer.mjs` | How your app requests and pays for the protected result. |
| `src/fulfillment.mjs` | What your paid Express endpoint returns. |

## Start here: empty folder to a working testnet demo

Go to **[reapp.live/hackathon](https://reapp.live/hackathon)** and follow five steps:

1. **Choose one** of the 20 starter packs.
2. **Open an empty folder** in VS Code, then select **Terminal → New Terminal**.
3. Click **Use this starter**, then copy the setup command displayed for that pack.
4. Paste the command into the terminal and press **Enter**. It downloads the starter into the empty folder and installs its exact dependencies.
5. Run **`npm run demo`**, then open the Stellar testnet links printed in the terminal.

That is the complete beginner path. You do **not** need a wallet or a GitHub repository. The starter creates disposable testnet actors, and private signing material stays on your computer.

    style F fill:#0f172a,stroke:#7b73ff,color:#f8fafc
```

### What the copied setup command does

The page shows one setup command for the starter you choose. Copy it as-is; it verifies the versioned REAPP installer, and that installer verifies the ZIP against its exact published SHA-256 before extracting anything. It then removes the temporary files and installs the locked dependencies. A changed or incomplete download is deleted before extraction.

When the setup command finishes, run:

```bash
npm run demo
```

The latest recorded clean-room run of the default starter completed setup and its full demo in **48.317 seconds**. Network and package-cache speed vary, so “about 60 seconds” is a measured target—not a guarantee.

### Prefer to inspect a clone first?

The ZIPs are the shortest beginner path. Security reviewers can run the same generated starter directly from the public source repository:

```bash
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/reapp-protocol/reapp-protocol-demo.git
cd reapp-protocol-demo/starters/hackathon
npm ci
npm run demo
```

Every starter folder is self-contained. Replace `hackathon` with any of the other starter slugs in the table above.

### What success looks like

The terminal uses six numbered, plain-English steps. It explains that `402 Payment Required` means the API is protected—not broken—then shows contract-controlled settlement, the retried `200` response, full clickable Stellar explorer links, and the starter's named safety or recovery result. Set `REAPP_VERBOSE=1` only when you also want the underlying developer event names.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    autonumber
    participant A as Consumer agent
    participant F as Express fulfillment
    participant M as MandateRegistry
    participant S as Stellar testnet

    A->>F: GET protected resource
    F-->>A: 402 Payment Required + bound challenge
    A->>M: Submit the exact contract payment
    M->>S: Verify authority and settle
    S-->>A: Confirmed transaction hash
    A->>F: Retry GET with bound proof
    F-->>A: 200 + paid result
    A->>M: Attempt the named negative path
    M-->>A: Reject outside mandate authority
```

The SDK and Express middleware are untrusted clients of the contract. Merchant scope, amount, expiry, replay state, and remaining authority are verified before paid work is delivered.

## Live protocol surfaces

This repository powers the implementation guide and inspectable demonstrations at [reapp.live](https://reapp.live):

| Surface | What it demonstrates |
|---|---|
| [**Docs**](https://reapp.live/) | SDK installation, consumer flow, Express verification, testnet execution, and safety boundary. |
| [**CLI**](https://reapp.live/cli) | Actor setup, mandate creation, payment, and terminal rejection paths. |
| [**Consumer**](https://reapp.live/consumer) | A product preview for turning a consumer request, budget, scope, expiry, and approval rule into bounded agent authority. |
| [**Express**](https://reapp.live/express) | `402` challenge, contract settlement, one-time redemption, and `200` fulfillment. |
| [**Hackathon**](https://reapp.live/hackathon) | Twenty blank-folder starters plus the optional hosted Research Source Scout walkthrough. |
| [**AP2**](https://reapp.live/ap2) | Intent and transaction mandate binding, canonical signatures, scope, expiry, and replay checks. |
| [**Composite mandates**](https://reapp.live/composites) | Multiple buyer agents coordinating an atomic group purchase. |
| [**Research agent**](https://reapp.live/research) | Paid-source selection constrained by an on-chain budget. |
| [**Video paywall**](https://reapp.live/video) | Three permitted unlocks followed by a contract-rejected fourth payment. |

Machine-readable maps are available at [`/llms.txt`](https://reapp.live/llms.txt), [`/llms-full.txt`](https://reapp.live/llms-full.txt), [`/sitemap.xml`](https://reapp.live/sitemap.xml), and [`/robots.txt`](https://reapp.live/robots.txt).

REAPP is the live implementation companion to [REAPP NETWORK](https://reapp.network), the source-linked research and architecture field guide for agentic payments.

## Run this site locally

```bash
npm ci
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). Everything is configured for Stellar **testnet**; never use mainnet keys in this demo.

Run the hackathon gate check before changing the starter library:

```bash
npm run gatecheck:hackathon
```

The research agent additionally supports Anthropic and OpenAI. Add one or both variables to `.env.local` (already ignored by Git) and to the deployed environment:

```dotenv
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=
OPENAI_API_KEY=
```

Without an LLM key, the starter library, Express, CLI, AP2, composite, and video demonstrations remain available; the research page shows a clear notice.
